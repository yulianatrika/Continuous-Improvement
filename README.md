🧩 Continuous Improvement: Defect Reduction in Electronic Manufacturing Process

📍 Sep 2025 – Oct 2025 | Python, Six Sigma DMAIC, Logistic Regression

📘 Project Overview

This project applies Six Sigma DMAIC methodology and data-driven analysis to identify and reduce production defects in an electronic manufacturing process.
Using Python-based statistical analysis and logistic regression, the study evaluates how factors such as supplier quality, delivery delay, maintenance hours, and worker productivity affect product defect rates.

The project simulates improvement scenarios and provides actionable recommendations to support continuous improvement and cost efficiency in manufacturing operations.

🎯 Objectives

- Identify root causes contributing to high defect rates using Six Sigma DMAIC.
- Quantify the impact of operational variables on defect probability.
- Simulate process improvements and optimize maintenance scheduling.
- Propose data-driven recommendations for sustainable defect reduction.
